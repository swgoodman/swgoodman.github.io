*"Stretch goals inspire us to think big and remind us to focus on the big picture."*

I created Out There to help teams get over the little things and think big. There are numerous task management systems used by commercial and creative teams focused on the relative short term. How do we get from point A to B? From this quarter to next? From conception to launch?

I wanted to make a Web Application that caters to the big picture, the "stretch goal." So I created a place for teams to share and vet their far reaching ideas, together. Upon signing up, a user joins their team on a shared board. Here, anyone can post a new crazy idea and others can like and discuss it. In the future I plan to add aspects that are meant to spur ideas and inspiration, such as random photos from Unsplash and Tech news, through relevant API's.

The front end of the application was built with the React framework. This was my first experience working with the framework, and it is pretty slick. It is intuitive, once you understand the general structure, and, with the help of redux, scalable. I definitely plan to build more projects with the framework. 

The back end is built with Rails, utilizing Active Record for data persistence and a MVC structure. Connecting the front end to the Rails back end was a trying, but rewarding experience. I gained a deeper understanding of asynchronous loading, fetch requests, and middleware, such as Thunk.

Check out the [front end](https://github.com/swgoodman/out-there) and [back end](https://github.com/swgoodman/out-there-api) on Github.
