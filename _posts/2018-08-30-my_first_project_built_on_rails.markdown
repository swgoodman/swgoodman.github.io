Working on this project was an incredibly rewarding experience that opened my eyes to the incredible amount of information I have learned from this course. It was also a reminder of how much there still is to learn.  The project requirements are certainly met, but I still would like to work on the front end more to make the interface more user friendly. Below I outline what the app is capable of and some struggles I faced along the way.

### What it does
My Rails project is called "Jobs". Not in reference to the above Jobs. I just felt the post needed some imagery. 

It is a web app designed to help job seekers keep track of leads as they network and interview. A user is able to sign up, through Github or with an email, and is greeted with a blank "Dashboard". The "Dashboard" is where all "Leads" are shown. A user can create "Leads" that summarize potential jobs they are interested in. An instance of a "Lead" contains the job opening's company, website, city, contact person, their email, phone number, and status. A status can be "Warm", meaning you have connected with a specific individual at the company and the outlook is promising, or "Cold", meaning you are applying through a website or reaching out to an individual for the first time (The approach is not recommended, but job seekers typically want to cast a wide net and you never know). Users are able to filter their leads by status, showing only "Warm" leads or "Cold" leads.  

### Struggles
This project took me significantly longer than the previous two for a couple of reasons. One, OmniAuth and setting up Github login functionality. With no Learn lesson to reference it was one of the first functionalities I have built on my own. It took a couple of days, but after hours of googling and trial and error I was able to implement the feature. Second, websites are complex! After working under the hood of web apps over the past few months I've begun to see the sheer amount of work required to make them not just work, but work *well*. I can confidently put together a relatively basic site, but as we step up the complexity of our projects, more bugs show up in unexpected places. They can take a while to squash.

Overall, this was a fantastic experience and further solidified that programming is a good career fit for me. Looking forward, I am excited to build more sites on Rails and continually improve their quality and functionality.
